## Welcome to Tanis, my self-driving R/C car.

I graduated from Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree in November of 2017. Once I graduated I wanted to put my skills to the test and build my own self-driving car.  Since I figured it would be dangerous to start messing with my actual car, I decided to build a self-driving R/C car.  

My goals for this project were simple.  
- Project costs below $200
- Car must be able to navigate any track using a black 'street' and yellow and white lane lines
- Car must avoid obstacles
- Car must be able to pass other slow moving cars
- Maintain position at the center of the lane
- Everything runs on the Raspberry pi.

To begin the project, I bought a Sunfounder Pi-Car-S [Amazon]  (https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Raspberry-Smart-Robot-Car/dp/B06XYZRBNJ)
